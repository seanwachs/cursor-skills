# Sync AI Rules

Checks and reconciles AI rules across Cursor (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`), Claude Code (`.claude/rules/*.md`), and GitHub Copilot (`.github/copilot-instructions.md` + `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`).

---

## Rule locations and formats

### Cursor — `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`
Each file is a Markdown file with optional YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
---
description: "Human-readable description of when to apply this rule"
globs: "src/**/*.ts"      # optional — restricts to matching files
alwaysApply: true          # if true, always injected; if false, agent decides based on description
---
# Rule content here
```
Modes: `alwaysApply: true` = always, `alwaysApply: false` + description = agent-decided, globs = file-scoped.

### Claude Code — `.claude/rules/*.md`
Plain Markdown files. Optional frontmatter for path-scoping:
```yaml
---
paths: ["src/**/*.ts", "tests/**"]
---
# Rule content here
```
Rules without `paths` apply unconditionally. File names are free-form.

### Copilot — `.github/copilot-instructions.md` + `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`
- **Repo-wide**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — plain Markdown, no frontmatter, always applied.
- **Path-specific**: `.github/instructions/NAME.instructions.md` — frontmatter with `applyTo` glob:
```yaml
---
applyTo: "**/*.ts,**/*.tsx"
---
# Rule content here
```
Both types support an optional `excludeAgent: "code-review"` or `excludeAgent: "coding-agent"` field.

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Discover all rule files
```bash
# Cursor rules
find .cursor/rules -name "*.mdc" 2>/dev/null | sort

# Claude Code rules
find .claude/rules -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | sort

# Copilot rules
ls .github/copilot-instructions.md 2>/dev/null
find .github/instructions -name "*.instructions.md" 2>/dev/null | sort
```
Read the content of every file found. Strip YAML frontmatter before comparing content — only compare the actual rule text.

### Step 2 — Group rules by topic/scope
Cluster the rules you find into logical groups based on their content:
- **Always-on / global rules** (no file scoping): e.g. code style, naming conventions, commit format
- **Language/path-scoped rules**: e.g. TypeScript rules, test file rules, backend-only rules
- **Tool-specific rules**: anything that only makes sense for one provider (e.g. Copilot review behaviour via `excludeAgent`)

### Step 3 — Compare across providers
For each rule group, check if an equivalent rule exists in all three providers. Build a comparison table:

```
## 🔍 Rule Sync Status

| Rule / Topic | Cursor | Claude Code | Copilot | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [topic] | ✅ `.cursor/rules/NAME.mdc` | ✅ `.claude/rules/NAME.md` | ✅ `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | In sync |
| [topic] | ✅ `.cursor/rules/NAME.mdc` | ❌ Missing | ✅ `.github/instructions/NAME.instructions.md` | ⚠️ Out of sync |
| [topic] | ✅ `.cursor/rules/NAME.mdc` | ✅ `.claude/rules/NAME.md` | ✅ present | ⚠️ Content differs |
```

For each "⚠️ Out of sync" or "⚠️ Content differs" row, include:
- A summary of what differs (missing entirely, different wording, contradictory instructions, scope mismatch)
- The specific lines or sections that differ

### Step 4 — Propose reconciliation
For each out-of-sync rule, propose the canonical version and show the exact change needed for each affected provider. Use this format:

```
### ⚠️ [Topic name]

**Issue:** [Brief description — e.g. "Rule exists in Cursor and Copilot but is missing from Claude Code" or "Copilot says X but Cursor says Y"]

**Proposed canonical rule:**
[The clean, agreed-upon version of the rule text]

**Changes needed:**
- **Cursor** (`.cursor/rules/NAME.mdc`): [No change needed / Add / Update with diff]
- **Claude Code** (`.claude/rules/NAME.md`): [No change needed / Add / Update with diff]
- **Copilot** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md` or `.github/instructions/NAME.instructions.md`): [No change needed / Add / Update with diff]
```

### Step 5 — Ask for approval
Do NOT write any files yet. Present the full report and ask:
```
Ready to apply the above changes. Please review and confirm:
- `approve all` — apply all proposed changes across all providers
- `approve [topic]` — apply only the changes for a specific rule topic
- `approve cursor` / `approve claude` / `approve copilot` — apply changes for one provider only
- `skip [topic]` — skip a specific rule
- Edit any proposed rule above before approving
```

### Step 6 — Apply approved changes
For each approved change, read the current file content, apply the edit, and write the file back. When adding a new rule file for a provider, use the correct format for that provider (see formats above). When updating an existing file, make surgical edits — do not rewrite unrelated sections.

---

## Handling format differences
Some rules have no 1:1 equivalent across formats:
- **Cursor `alwaysApply: true`** → Claude Code: add rule without `paths` frontmatter → Copilot: add to `copilot-instructions.md`
- **Cursor glob-scoped rule** → Claude Code: add `paths` frontmatter → Copilot: create a `NAME.instructions.md` with matching `applyTo` glob
- **Copilot `excludeAgent: "code-review"`** → Note in the proposal that this is Copilot-specific and has no equivalent for the other providers; suggest keeping it as-is

---

## Rules
- Never write files without explicit user approval
- When the same instruction is worded differently across providers but means the same thing, flag it as a style difference (not a conflict) and let the user decide whether to harmonize the wording
- If a rule is intentionally provider-specific (e.g. Copilot review behaviour), mark it as intentional and exclude it from sync proposals
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones where a suitable file already exists
